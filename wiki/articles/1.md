# Use Case Brief
This flow walks through a simple balance sheet reconciliation. 
Data from various sources is joined together, then further prepared for logic testing, validation, and exception reporting, as well as summarization and report generation.

# Business Functions: Accounting, Tax
## Background
 - The accounting function collects, stores, and tracks financial and/or transactional information for the general ledger (GL)
 - The tax function converts, reconciles, computes and reports accounting data fit for tax purposes

## Key Challenges
 - Time and pressure to close
 - Constantly updated data
 - Disparate data sources
 - Systems do not readily produce data in the format that I need

## Things that matter to them
 - Reconciling data that exists across various different sources
 - Validation checks (do things “balance” and “tie-out”)
 - Auditable trail of steps
 
# Key Talk Track Elements
## Automation
 -  **Accuracy**  - migration from manual Excel-based processes that could be prone to user error and/or manipulation
 -  **Process Improvement**  - an automated process can change the frequency that you are reviewing critical data, broaden applications of said data, and ultimately transform the way you work

## Scalability
 -  **Reusability**  - critical that the solution can be leveraged repeatedly rather than creating multiple variations of same core concept
 -  **Branched Analysis**  – able to pivot the core dataset to show the metrics by region and year, and output that to a report, or even a visualization tool like Tableau
 -  **Standardization**  – if this is a standard operation done across N clients or portfolios, this flow can be packaged into app-as-recipe
 
## Governance
 -  **Auditability** - flow provides visual presentation of steps taken. Prepare recipes show scope and sequence of all changes, w/ comments left by developers over time. Easy change management when process ownership changes.
 - DSS Permissions - ability to provision read access for broad group, edit access for select few

## Other
 -  **Output Flexibility**  – Excel (including multi-sheet within a workbook) is one of several options to “consume” the desired output of a flow
 -  **Tools Within Tools**  – e.g. select and compute columns post-join for computational and organizational flow efficiency
